The repository is organized as follows:  
  GMM/ contains relevant code for Gaussian mixture models

  doc/  contains human-readable documentation.

  data/ contains one example dataset (6 Mocap sequences of various exercises)
        See the demos for how to run posterior inference on this data. 
        Other example datasets (from our NIPS 2012 paper) are available by contacting Mike via email.
